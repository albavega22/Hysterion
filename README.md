Hi! Welcome to Hysterion, my final master's thesis repository. 

Hysterion is not just a master's thesis; it is a study worth all of our time, study and interest. What you will be able to reproduce using the scripts and files in the repository is a study about how different techniques (NRC, Hugging Face, sentimentr and GPTs) analyse novels written by men and women.
The project studies how women and men express anxiety and depression in literary texts and whether current Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools can adequately detect these emotions, especially in female-authored works. Our two principal questions to answer were:

1. Do women express feelings of anxiety and depression in the same way as men in their literary works?

2. If not, what are the specific lexical, syntactic, and stylistic features women use to express such emotions?

By using the files in Hysterion, you will be able to study the following novels:

- The Bell Jar, by Sylvia Plath
- To the Lighthouse, by Virginia Woolf
- The Yellow Wallpaper, by Charlotte Perkins Gilman
- Sons and Lovers, by Lawrence
- The Sun Also Rises, by Hemingway
- The Sound and the Fury, by Faulkner

But you can use the codes and functions to analyse any model you want! You will only need the .txt of each of the books and **your own Hugging Face API token** (remember this, it is REALLY important if you want to replicate my work!). 
With Hysterion, preliminary conclusions were found. Models like NRC or Hugging Face do not detect correctly either anxiety or depression, but they work especially badly in novels written by women. Nevertheless, so many other findings are waiting to be... Well: found! 
Enjoy Hysterion!
